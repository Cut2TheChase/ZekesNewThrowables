# ZekesNewThrowables
A new mod for Necropolis using Partiality and AbraxisToolset that adds new throwables to the game!

## *A Mysterious Letter Appears in your Pocket*
Why hello there Adventurer! I'm glad my message has been able to reach you successfully. My name is Zeke, creator of all things strange yet throwable!

I know you're probably wondering, 'Why has the great and mystical Zeke sent for my attention?' Well it just so happens that that my apprentice has managed to sneak in my new wares past Brazen's all seeing eye, so I'm here to spread the good news to you! You should start to see a few new recipies and throwables around, such as: 

* Zeke's Brash Hatch Jar
* Zeke's Mystery Hatch Jar
* Zeke's Lord Horde Jar
* Zeke's Daft Blast Jar
* Zeke's Cosmic Toxic Flask
* Zeke's Sure Cure Flask

Be sure to give these a try as you're delving into Necropolis, happy Throwing!

## How To Install
If you wish to install this mod, you are going to need the newest version of both the PartialityLauncher as well as AbraxisToolset. The PartialityLauncher is what is used to patch Necropolis and inject/rearrange code within the game, and AbraxisToolset which is a patch that gives developers access to Necropolis-specific modding tools :)

You can install each of them here-

[PartialityLauncher](https://github.com/PartialityModding/PartialityLauncher)

[AbraxisToolset](https://github.com/Cut2TheChase/AbraxisToolset) 

Once you have both of these, you patch Necropolis using PartialityLauncher, play the game, then grab the Zekes New Throwables release on this github and place the CSV folder and the ZekesNewThrowables.dll in the 'Mods' folder (dont put the .dll in the CSV folder, else Partiality wont be able to find it), then got to PartialityLauncher and patch the game with both AbraxisToolset and ZekesNewThrowables checked off, and you'll be good to go!

and yes, this mod does work in Multiplayer, but everyone must have the mod installed ;)
